# Women's Mentoring App: Mentor Matching Functionality

This project was completed in partnership with The Women's Business School and QUT's IT Capstone program. The purpose of this project was to create a mentor matching feature that would contribute to a larger ongoing goal of creating a woman's mentoring app. This repository contains the code portion of the deliverables. 

### Getting Started
This README.md includes brief instructions on how to run the app. For a more indepth explanation of the code, a Handover Document has been created to act as a user guide and point of reference for continued development. Copies can be found in this repository and in the handover package provided to Peace and Katy. 

It is recommended that the first step of your project be to read through this handover document, as well as review any additional content provided in the handover package. 

Contact details have been provided in the handover document for each team member, as well as our roles in the project. We are happy for you to reach out if any issues arise with the setup/handover of the project. 

### How to Run
1. Refer to 'How to Get Started' in the Handover Document. Read all instructions carefully to set up the necessary prerequisites before attempting to run the application.
2. In terminal, run `npm install` and wait for installation to complete
3. In terminal, run `npx expo start` and wait for Metro Bundler to complete
4. Ensure terminal output indicates 'Using Expo Go'
5. Open the Expo Go app on your phone. Locate and select the project under the 'Development servers' section. Alternatively, scan the QR code in the terminal using the 'Scan QR code' option on Android or your phone camera on iPhone.

**Note:** Both the PC and phone being used must be on the same Wi-Fi network for this to work.
